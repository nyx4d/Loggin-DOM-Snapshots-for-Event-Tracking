# Loggin-DOM-Snapshots-for-Event-Tracking
It creates a logData object containing:  The event type A stringified version of the DOM snapshot A timestamp Any additional data passed to the function.


The logDomSnapshot function takes two parameters:

eventType: The type of event being logged
additionalData: An optional object for any extra data (default is an empty object)


It captures a snapshot of the DOM using a getNodeInfo function.


It creates a logData object containing:

The event type
A stringified version of the DOM snapshot
A timestamp
Any additional data passed to the function


It then sends this data to a PHP script (eventLogs/log_event.php) using a POST request.
The response from the server is logged to the console (success or error).
An example usage is provided, attaching a click event listener to the document that logs a DOM snapshot along with the x and y coordinates of the click.

This approach allows you to capture the state of the DOM at the time of specific events, which can be useful for debugging, user behavior analysis, or creating replay functionality.
